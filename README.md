# Semi-parametric Modeling of Temporal Trends for Cholera Outbreak in Haiti

Haiti had been cholera-free for at least 100 years. However, there has been a severe outbreak of cholera in Haiti about 10 months after the catastrophic earthquake in 2010 and the reason is still not clear. Statistical modeling can help us understand how the disease is evolved and transmitted, but not much work has been done. 

In this report, under the framework of semi-parametric modeling, smoothing spline Poisson regression, zero-inflated Poisson regression, a latent Gaussian model and two Bayesian linear mixed models are applied to study the temporal trend of cholera cases for each department in Haiti. I find that the trends fitted by different models are similar to each other and departments that are geographically close tend to have similar temporal patterns.
